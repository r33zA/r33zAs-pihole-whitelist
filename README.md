# r33zAs-pihole-whitelist



**NOTE!** - The original script is created by Anudeep - https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist

**NOTE!**  - This has been highly modified and is useless for most setups. 



I'm doing this for two reasons; 

A) as learning a ground for myself,

B) and to quickly add specifically needed domains to my Pi-hole.



**!** This now also removes the default adlists.list to use only <https://dbl.oisd.nl> for my preferred setup.  
**!** This now adds mmotti's regex file - https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex
